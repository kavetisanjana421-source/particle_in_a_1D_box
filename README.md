# Particle in a Box (1D & 2D)

This project explores the concept of a quantum particle confined in a one-dimensional and two-dimensional box.  
Using Python, I derived the Schrödinger wave equations and plotted the probability distributions and energy levels for different states.

## 1D Box
- Solved the Schrödinger equation for a particle in a 1D infinite potential wall.
- Visualized the wavefunctions and probability densities using matplotlib.
- Experimented with different quantum numbers to see how energy levels vary.

## 2D Box
- Extended the same idea to two dimensions.
- Here i explained degeneracy that arises due to the dependence of Energy on (n_x^2 + n_y^2).
- Used contour and surface plots to visualize wavefunctions and degeneracy.
- Compared degeneracies between different states.

## Tools & Libraries

## About
I made this project as part of my learning in Quantum Mechanics and Python.  
It helped me understand how mathematical equations translate into visual patterns.
I thank my physics teacher,(Dr.Rekha Dom), for inspiring me to connect physcics concepts with python.
